                        <h3 style="padding-top: 2em"><strong>This is a crucial stage for both parents and kids alike<br>with some very pressing questions.</strong></h3>

                        <p class="text-primary" style="font-size: 24px; padding-top:2em">“What is the purpose of pre-school education?”</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 18px">The answer to this is that the very foundation of a child’s education lies on pre-school education. Whatever the child learns in the future is based on the skills and knowledge he or she acquires at this young age. Also if the right platform is set for learning the child finds it easy to cope with pressure and can learn and grasp at a faster rate.
                            <br>
                            <br>Thus to lay this founding stone to a bright future ahead pre-school education is of utmost importance.</p>
